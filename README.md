I've specialized in schematic and layout design using Cadence software, 
ensuring compliance with project specifications. 
I've conducted detailed performance analyses, designed layouts for key components, 
and developed digital modules like AND, OR, NAND, NOR, NOT, transmission gates. 
I've also created shift registers, counters, Flip-Flops, SRAM memory cells, 
and optimized amplifiers to meet performance targets.
